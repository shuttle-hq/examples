# Web Sockets with AXUM 
This example shows how to use axum to develop a web socket [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/0.1.1/axum/ws/index.html).
The idea is that the `lib.rs` file handles the client and user and http requests and opens the web sockets.

# Run it
We can start our application using the shuttle CLI.
Run it locally: `cargo shuttle run`
Curl it to test it: `curl localhost:8000/hello`
